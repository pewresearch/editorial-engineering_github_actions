# Sticky PR comment

Forked from https://github.com/Automattic/vip-actions

This is a copy of an MIT-licensed community GitHub Action that formats a comment to a pull request. The original action can be found at [marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment](https://github.com/marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment/tree/v2.9.0). Since GitHub Actions gain read access to our private repositories, making a copy ensures that we can audit changes and not expose ourselves to potential supply-chain attacks against the community repository.
